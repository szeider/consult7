# Release Notes v3.1.1

## Documentation Improvements

This patch release enhances the README to better showcase Gemini 3 Pro and power-user features:

- **New "Featured Model: Gemini 3 Pro" section** - Prominently highlights Google's flagship reasoning model before installation
- **Enhanced mnemonic visibility** - Quick reference mnemonics (gemt, gptt, grot, gemf, ULTRA) now featured prominently
- **Improved model table** - Gemini 3 Pro marked as "Flagship reasoning model" in the supported models list

No code changes - documentation only.

## Why This Release?

v3.1.0 added Gemini 3 Pro support but the README didn't prominently feature it. Users discovering Consult7 on PyPI will now immediately see:
1. Gemini 3 Pro as the flagship model
2. Convenient mnemonics for power users
3. The ULTRA pattern for parallel execution

These improvements make it easier for new users to discover and use the most powerful features.
